This is my **first Spring Boot project**, built using **Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, JPA, MySQL, and Lombok**.  
It’s a simple **Todo Management Web App** where users can add tasks, mark them as completed, view pending/completed tasks separately, and delete tasks.  
The frontend is dynamic and responsive, built entirely with **Thymeleaf + Bootstrap**.
