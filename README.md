## Introduction
This is my **first project using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, Lombok, and JPA**.  
The goal was to create a simple yet functional Todo management web application where users can add, view, mark as done, and delete tasks.  
This project helped me learn **integrating backend and frontend technologies** and dynamically rendering pages with **Thymeleaf**.

## Features
- Add new tasks using an input form.  
- View all tasks in a clean, responsive layout.  
- Mark tasks as **Completed**, which updates the style to strikethrough.  
- Delete individual tasks.  
- Separate page for viewing completed tasks.  
- Responsive UI with **Bootstrap 5**.  
- Database interaction using **Spring Data JPA** and **MySQL**.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot** – Backend framework for handling requests and business logic.  
- **Thymeleaf** – Template engine for dynamic HTML rendering.  
- **Bootstrap 5** – Styling and responsive frontend.  
- **JPA (Hibernate)** – Object-relational mapping for MySQL database.  
- **Lombok** – To reduce boilerplate code in entities and services.  
- **MySQL** – Database for storing tasks.
