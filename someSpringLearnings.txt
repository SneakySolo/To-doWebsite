TOTALY UNRELATED for you but required for me.
In case I need t brush up my springboot, here is some notes I made while making a different project (Patient demo) -

here I will explain what is happening

at first the client send data to the Controller and the request parameter is PatientsDTO
there (at the PatientsDTO) the client enters all the req fields,
the return type is PatientsResponseDTO as keeping Patients there will expose sensitive data to clients
and so we keep PatientsResponseDTO there as that is what we want to show,
lastly the return is service.savePatients(dto).

in the Service Layer,
var patient = mapper.toEntity(dto); converts the DTO (data from user) to Entity which can be saved in the DB,
var savedPatient = repo.save(patient); here the Entity is saved in the DB
and then we return mapper.toResponseDTO(savedPatient); in which the entity is turned back to a DTO
because we only reveal partial data to client

now since first when DTO to Entity happened there the PatientRepo was used, it talks to DB using JPA

also the Patients is a representation of the Table in DB.

Layers -
    Control Layer - here client sends us data
    Service Layer - called by Control Layer
                  - here the DTO-Entity-DB-ResponseDTO happens

    Mapper        - called by Service Layer to converts DTO → Entity
    Repository    - called by Service Layer to save to DB

    Database      - called by Repository to perform SQL operations

    and then again,
    Mapper        - called by Service (again) to convert to ResponseDTO
    Control Layer - atlas returns ResponseDTO
